#Widgetorium
This is a web app that allows the purchasing of widgets. Users create an account which gives them access to the web store where they can buy widgets. Once a quantity of widgets are purchased, they appear in the user's order history where they can see the status of the order. There is an admin view in the /test route that admins have access too view the widget table, user table, and order table. Admins can also modify, delete, and add widgets as well as modify existing users.
